								<h3>Development Consulting</h3>
								<p>The inter-relationship between public policy and business success is stronger
									than most businesses realize. Social activities are often inter-twined with
									economic activities implying that decision-makers have a good understanding
									of how to influence both, in order to ensure sustainable development for
									their communities.</p>
								<p>Further, sustainable development goals (SDGs) now significantly influence
									capacity to attract quality funding and access to business opportunities. At
									Ventura, we provide advise on how to navigate social and economic policies,
									and implement developmental initiatives.</p>
								<p></p>
								<ul>
									<li>Financial Access and Inclusion</li>

								<h3>Training</h3>
								<p>At Ventura, we focus on the outcome of learning rather than the learning
									activity. This has helped us to tailor learning to the objectives of our clients.We are concerned with what individuals and firms do with what they learn, how they go about it and whether learning is relevant to an individual or organization.</p>
								<p>We deliver innovative and modern training sessions to equip our clients with
									the tools to stay ahead and drive the objectives of their organizations.
									Through our Ventura Academy, we offer relevant financial and business
									training tailored to SMEs.</p>

								<h3>Research</h3>
								<p>Analyses and data administration is critical to understanding phenomena and
									achieving objectives, and managers are constantly in need of information that
									help achieve their objectives. Employees are frequently not in a position to
									provide these data and analyses due to either workload or ‘business-as-usual’
									mind-set. Managers therefore, require a professional view of available
									opportunities and how to tap into them.</p>
								<p>At Ventura, we undertake analyses and provide strategic information needed
for the achievement of planned projects and to take advantage of
opportunities.</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Development Research</li>
									<li>Data Collection</li>
									<li>Data Analysis</li>
									<li>Research Simulation</li>
